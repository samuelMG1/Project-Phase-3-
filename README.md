## Dimension Data Customer Attrition Prediction 
## Overview
Dimension Data is a leading African born technology provider operating in the Middle East and Africa, offering a portfolio of services including systems integration, managed services infrastructure, cloud solutions, business applications, customer experience, and intelligent security solutions.Founded in 1983.
Dimension Data is faced with a challenge where there is a high churn rate with most of its customers abandoning their services and switching to their competitors.
 The company has identified this problem and is now seeking to build a classifier that will help them predict whether a customer will soon stop doing business with them. 
This will be done by proper analysis using their dataset to gain insights on what factors result in a high churning rate. A prediction model will be developed and this will provide insights and recommendations to the telecommunication company that will help them retain customers and avoid Account Cancellations.
# Problem statement
To develop a machine learning model that can be used to predict and determine the probability of Loss of Customers on the  service and what factors result in this.
# Objectives
•	To identify the features that are likely to cause a customer to drop off.
•	To develop a machine learning model that will accurately predict the customers that are at a high risk of Account Cancellations.
•	To come up with measures to prevent customers who are at high risk from  Droping-off.
## Business Understanding.
Customer attrition, the loss of clients or customers, is a significant issue for industries like telecommunications and Communication Technology. Effectively managing and reducing attrition is essential for businesses operating in these sectors.
The primary objective of this project is to enhance customer retention by investigating the key factors associated with customers unsubscribing from a service, specifically within the telecommunication sector. The focus is on identifying patterns that may predict customer churn and devising strategies to address this phenomenon.
 The overarching goal is to minimize financial losses attributed to customers who discontinue their services. The project seeks to uncover discernible patterns in customer behavior leading to dropping off.

## conclusion
The Random Forest classifier has a recall score of 73% for predicting customer churn, effectively identifying many actual churners. While this is a good start, further feature engineering could enhance the model's performance. Improving recall is crucial for reducing misclassifications and better retaining at-risk customers. Continuous refinement through feature engineering is recommended to boost the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

## Recommendations
To address higher churn rates, it is recommended to implement targeted promotional strategies, such as offering exclusive discounts to customers in specific regions. Improving customer service by enhancing training programs for representatives is also proposed to boost satisfaction and reduce churn. Additionally, reviewing the pricing structure for various charges and introducing discounted packages can make offerings more competitive. Lastly, enhancing the voicemail plan's value through new features or discounts aims to increase customer adoption and retention.
